**Senior Software Engineer at London Stock Exchange Technologies (part of London Stock Exchange Group) (Apr. 2017 - Aug. 2019)**
- LSEG Technology is the technology arm of the London Stock Exchange Group. LSEG technology excels in Market Infrastructure technology suite that includes robust, scalable and high-performance solution for operators of exchanges, clearing houses, central securities depositories and related businesses.
- I worked on the Post Trade product developed for Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX)
- I have contributed to development of several gateways such as **Downstream gateway, SBL Interface, SGXNetGateway** and engines such as **IPO engine**. Furthermore, I contributed to development of a testing framework called **FortressPT** which allows to write tests using domain specific objects for Post Trade software solution.
  - **Downstream Gateway** – This is the gateway that delivers the transaction messages to downstream system for interfacing.
  - **SBL Interface** – Securities Borrowing and Lending Interface. This interface acts as an interface between two depositories for securities borrowing and lending activities.
  - **SGXNet Gateway** – This is an interface for receiving corporate action announcements for the Post trade system.
  - **FortressPT** – This is a testing framework that allows user to test the Post Trade system using Domain specific objects.
    - This framework enabled non-technical users to write test scenarios for the Post-Trade system without having to understand the technical aspects.
- Built automated bamboo CI pipeline to automate regression testing.
- During my time at LSEG technology, I gained experience in Java, Scala, C++, Python, SQL, CSS and JS languages and frameworks and technologies like IBM MQ, Vaadin, Oracle DB, Bamboo, Jasper and Akka, Cucumber, TestNG, Git, Linux.
- Experience in building scalable, distributed, multi-traded applications.

**Instructor/Graduate Teaching Assistant at Montana State University (Aug. 2019 - Dec. 2023)**
- During my time as a Ph.D. student, I have experience teaching computer science courses, including subjects, such as computer theory, data structures and algorithms. I also worked as a teaching assistant for courses such as computer systems, computer graphics, computer theory, data structures and algorithms, and discrete structures. This teaching background has allowed me to effectively communicate complex concepts to students and has also been instrumental in improving my overall communication skills. Engaging with students in the learning process has not only given me the opportunity to share theoretical knowledge but has also allowed me to foster a supportive environment, aiding in the development of my mentoring capabilities.

## Projects
### Post-Trade Product (LSEG Technology)
- This project was the Post‑Trade product developed for Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX)
- This system processes trade orders submitted by the Singapore stock exchange. This system is responsible for processing and settling trade orders, contacting various external and internal systems to determine the securities and money that needs to be exchanged between participants, processing various messages from external systems and conducting various corporate actions on securities and depository management.
- This system processes a massive amount of data in real‑time and as a batch that deals with settlements of the trades (orders) sent by the stock exchange.
- System communicates with a large number of internal and external systems, such as banks, depositories, clearing houses, stock exchanges, databases, brokers, reporting systems, regulators, etc.
- Contributed to development of large-scale, distributed gateways and engines related to the system (Java, Scala, C++)
- Contributed to front-end development (Vaadin, JavaScript, HTML)
- Gained **2.5 years** of experience in Distributed system development, large-scale system development, large-scale database handling and front-end development.
- Gained **2.5 years** of experience in **Java, Scala, C++, Python, JavaScript**.

### Fortress-PT
- This was a testing framework that is used to test Millennium Post Trade system that was developed by London Stock Exchange Technologies. With the help of this framework users can write tests suites using domain specific objects without worrying about underlying system specific technical details.
- This testing framework proved instrumental in enhancing testing efficiency within agile working cycles.
- Enabled non technical users to write test cases for testing the system.
- **Technologies, Standards and Frameworks**: Java 8, IBM MQ, MVEL, FIXML, SWIFT, Cucumber along with MillenniumIT proprietary frameworks.

### Private Cloud Management Platform – CloudBox
- CloudBox is a personal cloud product targeted for small companies and homes. This product would enable the user to create a local private cloud within his home or company with minimal technical expertise. The objectives of this project are to minimize the data usage of the cloud platform by reducing unwanted synchronizations, develop a management console that can simplify the usage and management of the cloud platform for the end user and develop a reliable and efficient private cloud platform for a small company or home.
- This tool empowered users to manage a private cloud with minimal expertise, offering a web-based dashboard for deploying diverse applications on their private servers.
- Leveraging OpenStack technology for virtual machine creation and Docker for application deployment, the system simplified the process, allowing users to deploy applications with a single click.

## Work Experience
**Senior Software Engineer at London Stock Exchange Technologies (part of London Stock Exchange Group) (Apr. 2017 - Aug. 2019)**
- LSEG Technology is the technology arm of the London Stock Exchange Group. LSEG technology excels in Market Infrastructure technology suite that includes robust, scalable and high-performance solution for operators of exchanges, clearing houses, central securities depositories and related businesses.
- I worked on the Post Trade product developed for Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX)
- I have contributed to development of several gateways such as **Downstream gateway, SBL Interface, SGXNetGateway** and engines such as **IPO engine**. Furthermore, I contributed to development of a testing framework called **FortressPT** which allows to write tests using domain specific objects for Post Trade software solution.
  - **Downstream Gateway** – This is the gateway that delivers the transaction messages to downstream system for interfacing.
  - **SBL Interface** – Securities Borrowing and Lending Interface. This interface acts as an interface between two depositories for securities borrowing and lending activities.
  - **SGXNet Gateway** – This is an interface for receiving corporate action announcements for the Post trade system.
  - **FortressPT** – This is a testing framework that allows user to test the Post Trade system using Domain specific objects.
    - This framework enabled non-technical users to write test scenarios for the Post-Trade system without having to understand the technical aspects.
- Built automated bamboo CI pipeline to automate regression testing.
- During my time at LSEG technology, I gained experience in Java, Scala, C++, Python, SQL, CSS and JS languages and frameworks and technologies like IBM MQ, Vaadin, Oracle DB, Bamboo, Jasper and Akka, Cucumber, TestNG, Git.

## Work Experience
**Senior Software Engineer at London Stock Exchange Technologies (part of London Stock Exchange Group) (Apr. 2017 - Aug. 2019)**
- LSEG Technology is the technology arm of the London Stock Exchange Group. LSEG technology excels in Market Infrastructure technology suite that includes robust, scalable and high-performance solution for operators of exchanges, clearing houses, central securities depositories and related businesses.
- I worked on the Post Trade product developed for Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX)
- I have contributed to development of several gateways such as **Downstream gateway, SBL Interface, SGXNetGateway** and engines such as **IPO engine**. Furthermore, I contributed to development of a testing framework called **FortressPT** which allows to write tests using domain specific objects for Post Trade software solution.
  - **Downstream Gateway** – This is the gateway that delivers the transaction messages to downstream system for interfacing.
  - **SBL Interface** – Securities Borrowing and Lending Interface. This interface acts as an interface between two depositories for securities borrowing and lending activities.
  - **SGXNet Gateway** – This is an interface for receiving corporate action announcements for the Post trade system.
  - **FortressPT** – This is a testing framework that allows user to test the Post Trade system using Domain specific objects.
    - This framework enabled non-technical users to write test scenarios for the Post-Trade system without having to understand the technical aspects.
- Built automated bamboo CI pipeline to automate regression testing.
- During my time at LSEG technology, I gained experience in Java, Scala, C++, Python, SQL, CSS and JS languages and frameworks and technologies like IBM MQ, Vaadin, Oracle DB, Bamboo, Jasper and Akka, Cucumber, TestNG, Git, Linux.
- Experience in building scalable, distributed, multi-traded applications.
  
**Software Engineer Intern at Proavos (pvt) Ltd. (now renamed under new leadership) (Nov. 2015 - Apr. 2016)**
  - Proavos was a startup company aiming to build state of the art software solutions and services for airlines, airports, travel agents and leisure companies.
  - I worked as a full stack developer working on both back-end and front-end.
  - During the internship period I developed a framework for Airline **BSP (Billing and Settlement Plan) system**.
  - During the internship I improved my skills on how to build a framework/Project from scratch such as starting from designing class diagrams, modeling the system and using different design patterns to enhance the framework quality.
  - I gained experience in JavaEE, Javascript, WildFly, JSP, Linux, FreeMarker and Domain knowledge on Aviation Industry Business aspects.

**Instructor/Graduate Teaching Assistant at Montana State University (Aug. 2019 - Dec. 2023)**
- During my time as a Ph.D. student, I have experience teaching computer science courses, including subjects, such as computer theory, data structures and algorithms. I also worked as a teaching assistant for courses such as computer systems, computer graphics, computer theory, data structures and algorithms, and discrete structures. This teaching background has allowed me to effectively communicate complex concepts to students and has also been instrumental in improving my overall communication skills. Engaging with students in the learning process has not only given me the opportunity to share theoretical knowledge but has also allowed me to foster a supportive environment, aiding in the development of my mentoring capabilities.
- Classes that I **instructed**:
	- Basic Data Structures and Algorithms - CSCI 132 (2022 Summer semester) 
	- Data Structures and Algorithms - CSCI 232 (2021 snowmester)
	- Computer Theory- CSCI 338 (2023 Fall Two weeks)
- Classes in which I worked as a Teaching Assistant 
    - Computer Graphics – CSCI 441 
    - Computer Systems – CSCI 366
    - Computer Theory – CSCI 338
    - Discrete Structures – CSCI 246 
    - Social & Ethical Issues in Computer Science – CSCI 215
    - Basic Data Structures and Algorithms- CSCI 132
    - Data Structures and Algorithms – CSCI 232 

## Projects
### Fortress-PT
- This was a testing framework that is used to test Millennium Post Trade system that was developed by London Stock Exchange Technologies. With the help of this framework users can write tests suites using domain specific objects without worrying about underlying system specific technical details.
- This testing framework proved instrumental in enhancing testing efficiency within agile working cycles.
- Enabled non technical users to write test cases for testing the system.
- **Technologies, Standards and Frameworks**: Java 8, IBM MQ, MVEL, FIXML, SWIFT, Cucumber along with MillenniumIT proprietary frameworks.

### Private Cloud Management Platform – CloudBox
- CloudBox is a personal cloud product targeted for small companies and homes. This product would enable the user to create a local private cloud within his home or company with minimal technical expertise. The objectives of this project are to minimize the data usage of the cloud platform by reducing unwanted synchronizations, develop a management console that can simplify the usage and management of the cloud platform for the end user and develop a reliable and efficient private cloud platform for a small company or home.
- This tool empowered users to manage a private cloud with minimal expertise, offering a web-based dashboard for deploying diverse applications on their private servers.
- Leveraging OpenStack technology for virtual machine creation and Docker for application deployment, the system simplified the process, allowing users to deploy applications with a single click.
- Mentor: Prof: Gihan Dias
- Paper: Three-tier Private Cloud Application Management System with On-Site Hardware (Published in 16th International Symposium On 
Parallel and Distributed Computing (ISPDC) 2017, Innsbruck, Austria

- **Technologies**: OpenStack, Docker, PHP, Laravel, CSS, JavaScript, HTML, Linux

### Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP) framework
- In my internship I developed a framework that enables airlines to publish agent sales data to the BSP (Billing and settlement Plan) system.
- This framework is used to retrieve and encode the sales data into IATA standard and publish it to a BSP system server automatically.
- This system communicates with the BSP system to send, receive and generate BSP information and reports.
- System communicates using differnt types of text and XML message standards defined by IATA standards.
- I helped to design, develop, and test this framework from scratch.
- **Technologies, Platform and Experience:** Java EE, SFTP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Linux, Git, UI design.

### Sales Leads Management System 
- The Sales Leads Management System addressed a segment of an ERP system focused on managing sales leads within a company. 
- This application can record, monitor, analyze sales Leads and generate performance reports for a given time period.
- I improved my skills in system design, design patterns, object-oriented programming, database management, reporting, and user interface design, along with my experience in C# and SQL
- **Technologies and Concepts:** C\#, MySQL, OOP

### Image based ballot-paper (vote) counting software
- This software was developed to read, count and classify Sri Lankan parliamentary election ballot papers. This software can recognize the party and up to three preferential votes. Software would process all the ballot papers assigned to it and output the cumulative results to the users.
- **Technologies:** OpenCV, C++
